# Fullstack homework challenge for Digital Thinkers

### Setup instructions:

To setup the project, first run `npm install` in the root directory, then run `npm install` in the `api` and `yarn install` in the `client` folders(inconsistency due to create-react-app using yarn internally, while I've used npm for my template project)

Before running the backend app, create a `.env` file where you put this: `SERVER_PORT=3001`

Then to run the both the frontend and backend apps, run `npm run start:dev` from the root directory.
