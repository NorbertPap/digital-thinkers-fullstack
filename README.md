# Fullstack homework challenge for Digital Thinkers

### Setup instructions:

To setup the project, first run `npm install` in the root directory, then run `npm install` in both the `api` and the `client` folders as well(try adding the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag if there's an issue with the dependency tree: I've encountered it with React's dependencies).

Before running the backend app, create a `.env` file where you put this: `SERVER_PORT=3001`

Then to run the both the frontend and backend apps, run `npm run start:dev` from the root directory.
